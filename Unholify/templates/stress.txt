Hey, hold on.
We're glad you owned up to this. ## both these lines in largest text on the page. Second line in smaller font

Alcohol 
isn't a dependency
isn't a solution
isn't a friend
isn't the way out.

###### NOT DEPRESSED #####

Phew.
We're happy you're fine.

We'd still suggest: Don't consume alcohol just because you're stressed. You never know when it consumes you.

Don't believe us? ## ye heading hai
Well then, don't take <i> our </i> word for it. See for yourself.
There's medical proof. A plethora of links. 
Let me see ## this is a button text. Hyperlinks to Google search on cons of alcohol consumption.
## the hyperlink is this https://www.google.co.in/search?q=why+shouldn%27t+i+drink+alcohol&rlz=1C1CHZL_enIN805IN805&oq=why+shou&aqs=chrome.0.69i59l2j69i57j69i60j0j35i39.1620j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8

It's doctors, surveys, experiences who dissuade you: DON'T fall into this vortex.

So what should I do then? ## heading

Alcohol is never the answer. Neither are any of the drugs.
